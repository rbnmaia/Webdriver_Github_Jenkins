# Webdriver_Github_Jenkins

Selenium WebDriver is the main tool to create browser-based automated regression tests and to configure and distribute scripts across many environments.

For test automation and continuous integration: Selenium WebDriver; GitHub; Jenkins CI; Java.

This script will create the hook to interpreate the repository where the project is hosted and make it communicate with the server where Jenkins will perform the continuous integration based on the QA test defined from Selenium.
